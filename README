POE/Component/Enc/Flac version 1.01
===================================

This is a POE component for wrapping the lossless audio encoder 'flac'

POE is a multitasking framework for Perl. FLAC stands for Free Lossless 
Audio Codec and 'flac' is an encoder for this standard. This module wraps
'flac' into the POE framework, simplifying its use in, for example, a CD music
ripper and encoder application. It provides an object oriented interface.

To use this module, you will need the POE framework (See http://poe.perl.org/)
and you will need to install the flac tool (See http://flac.sourceforge.net/).

1.01 is the first public issue of this module.
